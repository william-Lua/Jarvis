The "JARVIS" project aims to develop a voice-activated AI assistant using a Raspberry Pi. The system is designed to perform common tasks like answering user questions and possibly playing music, utilizing speech recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and text-to-speech (TTS) technologies to facilitate real-time interaction. The project will integrate a simple graphical user interface (GUI) to provide visual feedback, basic controls, and enhance the overall user experience. The Raspberry Pi serves as an affordable, compact platform for this system, combining local processing with cloud-based services to optimize performance. The final deliverable will be a self-sustaining, voice-controlled system capable of intelligent conversation and multimedia tasks.
